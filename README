## How it works

Most of the code is either self-explanatory or commented. 
An interesting detail to note is a simulation of exception catching/throwing using setjmp() and longjmp(). 
The function __run_command() in command.c contains a switch which is basically a try/catch where the function 
provided as a parameter is called. Exceptions are "thrown" using the longjmp() function on the same jmp_buf variable 
that setjmp() was used on.
